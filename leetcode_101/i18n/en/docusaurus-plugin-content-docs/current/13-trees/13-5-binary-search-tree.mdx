# 13.5 Binary Search Tree

A `Binary Search Tree` (BST) is a special type of binary tree: for every parent node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than or equal to the parent's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than or equal to the parent's value. Therefore, for a BST, we can determine whether a value exists in $O(\log n)$ time: starting from the root, move to the left if the current node's value is greater than the target value, or move to the right if it's smaller. Additionally, since a BST is ordered, an in-order traversal of the tree results in a sorted array.

For example, the tree below is a BST, and its in-order traversal yields [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

```
    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
1   3   6
```

## [99. Recover Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/)

### Problem Description

Given a binary search tree, where two nodes have been swapped by mistake, restore the tree to its correct structure.

### Input and Output Example

The input is a binary search tree where two nodes have been swapped, and the output is the corrected tree.

```
Input:
  3
 / \
1   4
   /
  2
Output:
  2
 / \
1   4
   /
  3
```

In this example, 2 and 3 were swapped by mistake.

### Solution Explanation

We can perform an in-order traversal of the BST and use a `prev` pointer to keep track of the previous node during traversal. If the current node's value is less than the `prev` node's value, it indicates an order mismatch that needs correction.

- If there's only one mismatch in the entire traversal, it means the two swapped nodes are adjacent.
- If there are two mismatches, the two non-adjacent nodes are swapped and need correction.

## [669. Trim a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/)

### Problem Description

Given a binary search tree and two integers L and R, where L < R, trim the tree so that all nodes in the tree have values within the range [L, R].

### Input and Output Example

Input is a binary search tree and two integers L and R. Output is the trimmed binary search tree.

```
Input: L = 1, R = 3, tree =
      3
     / \
    0   4
     \
      2
     /
    1
Output:
    3
   /
  2
 /
1
```

### Solution Explanation

By leveraging the properties of a binary search tree, we can efficiently solve this problem using recursion.
