# 13.1 Data Structure Introduction

As an upgraded version of the (single) linked list, the trees we commonly encounter are typically `binary trees`, where each node has at most two child nodes. Unless otherwise specified, trees are assumed to have no circular structures. LeetCode's default representation of trees is as follows:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

It can be seen that the primary difference compared to a linked list is the addition of a pointer for a second child node.
