# 14.3 Topological Sort

`Topological Sort` is a common algorithm used to order nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Given $N$ nodes in a DAG, the goal is to arrange them in a linear sequence such that if node $i$ points to node $j$, then $i$ appears before $j$ in the sequence. The result of a topological sort is not unique as long as the above condition is satisfied.

## [210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)

### Problem Description

Given $N$ courses and their prerequisites, determine an order in which all the courses can be completed.

### Input and Output Example

The input consists of a positive integer representing the number of courses and a 2D array representing directed edges (e.g., `[1,0]` indicates course 1 must be taken after course 0). The output is a 1D array representing a topological order.

```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3]
```

In this example, another valid order could be `[0,2,1,3]`.

### Solution Explanation

e can first build an adjacency matrix to represent the graph, facilitating direct lookups. Note that we reverse all edges, so if course $i$ points to course $j$, it means course $i$ must be completed before course $j$. This aligns with our intuitive understanding of prerequisites.

Topological sorting can be viewed as a special case of breadth-first search (BFS): 

1. Traverse all nodes and enqueue nodes with an in-degree of $0$ (i.e., nodes without prerequisites).
2. While processing the queue:
   - Add the current node to the sorted order.
   - Decrease the in-degree of all nodes it points to by $1$.
   - If a nodeâ€™s in-degree becomes $0$, enqueue it.
3. When the queue is empty, the nodes are either fully sorted, or a cycle exists in the graph, preventing all courses from being completed.
