# 9.3 Binary Features

By leveraging some binary features, we can apply bitwise operations to solve a wider range of problems.

For example, we can use binary and bitwise operations to generate all subsets of an array. Suppose we have an array of length $n$, we can generate all binary numbers of length $n$, where 1 indicates selecting the number, and 0 indicates not selecting it. This way, we obtain $2^n$ subsets.

## [318. Maximum Product of Word Lengths](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-word-lengths/)

### Problem Description

Given multiple strings, find the maximum product of lengths of any two strings such that the two strings do not share any common letters.

### Input and Output Example

Input is a one-dimensional array containing multiple strings, and output is an integer representing the maximum product of lengths.

```
Input: ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
Output: 4
```

In this example, one optimal pair is "ab" and "cd."

### Solution Explanation

How can we quickly determine if two strings share common letters? We can represent each string with a binary number of length 26, where each position indicates the presence of a specific letter. If two strings share common letters, their binary representations' bitwise AND will not be 0. Additionally, we can use a hash map to store the mapping from binary numbers to the longest string lengths. For example, "ab" and "aab" may have the same binary representation, but "aab" is longer.

## [338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

### Problem Description

Given a non-negative integer `n`, find the number of `1`s in the binary representation of every number from `0` to `n`.

### Input and Output Example

The input is a non-negative integer `n`, and the output is a list of non-negative integers of length `n + 1`, where each position `m` represents the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `m`.

```
Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
```

### Solution Explanation

This problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming and bitwise operations. Define an array `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the number `i`. For the number `i`:
- If the last bit of its binary representation is `1`, the count of `1`s is `dp[i-1] + 1`.
- If the last bit of its binary representation is `0`, the count of `1`s is the same as that of its arithmetic right-shift result, i.e., `dp[i>>1]`.
