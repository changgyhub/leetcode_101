# 9.2 Basic Problems in Bit Manipulation

## [461. Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/)

### Problem Description

Given two decimal numbers, calculate the Hamming distance between their binary representations (i.e., the number of differing bits).

### Input and Output Example

The input consists of two decimal integers, and the output is a decimal integer representing their Hamming distance.

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
```

In this example, the binary representation of 1 is `0001`, and that of 4 is `0100`, with two differing bits.

### Solution Explanation

Perform a bitwise XOR operation on the two numbers and count the number of `1`s in the result.

        diff >>= 1;
    }
    return dist;
}

        diff = diff >> 1
    return dist

## [190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

### Problem Description

Given a decimal positive integer, output its reversed binary representation.

### Input and Output Example

Both input and output are decimal positive integers.

```
Input: 43261596 (00000010100101000001111010011100)
Output: 964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
```

Using arithmetic left shift and right shift, binary reversal can be easily implemented.

### Solution Explanation

<TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">

```cpp
uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) {
    uint32_t m = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
        m <<= 1;
        m += n & 1;
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return m;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
def reverseBits(n: int) -> int:
    m = 0
    for _ in range(32):
        m = m << 1
        m += n & 1
        n = n >> 1
    return m
```

## [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

### Problem Description

Given an integer array, only one number in this array appears exactly once, while all other numbers appear twice. Find the number that appears only once.

### Input and Output Example

The input is a one-dimensional integer array, and the output is an integer from the array.

```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

### Solution Explanation

We can use the properties of x ∧ x = 0 and x ∧ 0 = x to solve this. By performing a bitwise XOR on all numbers in the array, the result of XORing all numbers that appear twice is 0. XORing 0 with the number that appears once gives the number itself.

```cpp
int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    int single = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        single ^= num;
    }
    return single;
}
```

def singleNumber(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    single = 0
    for num in nums:
        single = single ^ num
    return single
```

Here, we can also directly use the `reduce` function:

```cpp
int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    return reduce(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0,
                  [](int x, int y) { return x ^ y; });
}
```

```py
def singleNumber(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    return functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x ^ y, nums)
```
