# 12.3 Other Linked List Techniques

## [160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

### Problem Description

Given two linked lists, determine if they intersect at a point and find the intersecting node.

### Input and Output Example

Input consists of two linked lists, output is a node. If there is no intersection, return `nullptr`.

```
Input:
A: a1 -> a2
         |
         v
         c1 -> c2 -> c3
         ^
         |
B: b1 -> b2 -> b3
Output: c1
```

### Solution Explanation

Assume the distance from the head of linked list A to the intersection is `a`, the distance from the head of linked list B to the intersection is `b`, and the distance from the intersection to the end of the lists is `c`. 

We use two pointers starting at the heads of the two linked lists and move them forward at the same speed. When a pointer reaches the end of a list, it continues from the head of the other list. With this approach, both pointers will meet at the intersection node after `a + b + c` steps.

        l2 = l2 != nullptr ? l2->next : headA;
    }
    return l1;

## [234. Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)

### Problem Description

Determine if a linked list is a palindrome using $O(1)$ space complexity.

### Input and Output Example

Input: A linked list.  
Output: A boolean indicating whether the linked list is a palindrome.

```
Input: 1->2->3->2->1
Output: true
```

### Solution Explanation

First, use a slow and fast pointer to find the middle of the linked list. Then split the list into two halves. Reverse the second half and compare the two halves for equality.

<TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">

```cpp
bool isPalindrome(ListNode* head) {
    if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) {
        return true;
    }
    ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;
    while (fast->next && fast->next->next) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
    }
    slow->next = reverseList(slow->next);  // Refer to problem 206.
    slow = slow->next;
    while (slow != nullptr) {
        if (head->val != slow->val) {
            return false;
        }
        head = head->next;
        slow = slow->next;
    }
    return true;
}
```

<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
def isPalindrome(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
    if head is None or head.next is None:
        return True

    slow, fast = head, head

    while fast.next is not None and fast.next.next is not None:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

    slow.next = reverseList(slow.next)  # Refer to problem 206.
    slow = slow.next

    while slow is not None:
        if head.val != slow.val:
            return False
        head = head.next
        slow = slow.next

    return True

```
