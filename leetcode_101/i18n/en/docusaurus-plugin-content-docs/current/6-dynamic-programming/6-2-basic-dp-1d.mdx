# 6.2 Basic Dynamic Programming: One-Dimensional

## [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

### Problem Description

Given $n$ steps of stairs, you can either take one step or two steps at a time. Determine how many ways there are to climb to the top.


### Input and Output Example

Input is a single number representing the number of steps; output is the total number of ways to climb the stairs.

```
Input: 3
Output: 3
```

In this example, there are three ways to climb the three steps:
1. Take one step three times.
2. Take one step, then two steps.
3. Take two steps, then one step.

### Solution Explanation

This is a classic Fibonacci sequence problem. Define an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the $i^{th}$ step. Since you can either take one step or two steps, the $i^{th}$ step can be reached from the $(i-1)^{th}$ or the $(i-2)^{th}$ step. In other words, the number of ways to reach the $i^{th}$ step is the sum of the ways to reach the $(i-1)^{th}$ and $(i-2)^{th}$ steps. This gives us the state transition equation: `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`. Pay attention to the initial conditions.


:::warning

To handle boundary cases conveniently, we can reserve an extra position in the `dp` array to represent the initial state. In this problem, an extra initial position for step 0 is added.

    return dp[n]
```

</TabItem>

Furthermore, we can apply space optimization to dynamic programming. Since dp[i] only depends on dp[i-1] and dp[i-2], we can use just two variables to store dp[i-1] and dp[i-2], reducing the original $O(n)$ space complexity to $O(1)$.

## [198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)

### Problem Description

Suppose you are a robber deciding to rob houses along a street, where each house has a different amount of money. If you rob two adjacent houses, an alarm will be triggered. Determine the maximum amount of money you can rob without triggering the alarm.

### Input and Output Example

The input is a one-dimensional array `nums` representing the amount of money in each house; the output is the maximum amount of money the robber can steal.

```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
```

In this example, the optimal way to rob is to rob houses 1, 3, and 5.

### Solution Explanation

Define an array `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to the `i`-th house. To determine the value of `dp[i]`, there are two possible scenarios:

1. **Do not rob this house**: In this case, the accumulated amount is `dp[i-1]`.
2. **Rob this house**: The previously accumulated maximum amount can only be `dp[i-2]`, because robbing the `i-1`-th house would trigger the alarm.

Thus, the state transition equation for this problem is:

$$
dp[i] = \max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + \text{nums}[i-1])
$$

```cpp
int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
    dp[1] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], nums[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]);
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

def rob(nums: List[int]) -> int:

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], nums[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])
    return dp[n]
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Similarly, we can optimize space complexity just like in Problem 70. Since `dp[i]` only depends on `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`, we can use only two variables to store these two values, reducing the original $O(n)$ space complexity to $O(1)$ space complexity.

## [413. Arithmetic Slices](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices/)

### Problem Description

Given an array, calculate the total number of continuous arithmetic subarrays.

### Input and Output Example

Input is a one-dimensional array, and output is the number of continuous subarrays that meet the arithmetic condition.

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 3
```

In this example, the arithmetic subarrays are [1,2,3], [2,3,4], and [1,2,3,4].

### Solution Explanation

Since the requirement is for arithmetic subarrays, it naturally follows that the subarray must satisfy the condition `num[i] - num[i-1] = num[i-1] - num[i-2]`. Here, we define the `dp` array such that `dp[i]` represents the number of subarrays ending at index `i` that satisfy this condition. Because arithmetic subarrays can end at any position, we need to sum up the `dp` array to calculate the total number of subarrays.

        if (nums[i] - nums[i - 1] == nums[i - 1] - nums[i - 2]) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;
        }
    }
    return accumulate(dp.begin(), dp.end(), 0);
}
