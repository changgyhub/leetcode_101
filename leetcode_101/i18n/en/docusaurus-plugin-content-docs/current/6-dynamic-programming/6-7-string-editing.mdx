# 6.7 String Editing

## [72. Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

### Problem Description

Given two strings, you can delete, replace, or insert any character from either string. Find the minimum number of steps required to make the two strings identical.

### Input and Output Example

Input consists of two strings, and the output is an integer representing the minimum number of steps.

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
```

In this example, one optimal sequence of edits is horse -> rorse -> rose -> ros.

### Solution Explanation

Similar to problem 1143, we use a two-dimensional array `dp[i][j]`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of edits required to transform the first string up to position `i` and the second string up to position `j`.

- If the characters at position `i` and `j` are the same, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
- If the characters differ:
  - The cost of modification is `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
  - The cost of inserting at position `i`/deleting at position `j` is `dp[i][j-1] + 1`.
  - The cost of inserting at position `j`/deleting at position `i` is `dp[i-1][j] + 1`.

## [650. 2 Keys Keyboard](https://leetcode.com/problems/2-keys-keyboard/)

### Problem Description

Given the letter `A`, you can either copy all characters or paste the previously copied characters. Find the minimum number of operations needed to extend the string to the specified length.

### Input and Output Example

The input is a positive integer representing the target length, and the output is an integer representing the minimum number of operations required.

```
Input: 3
Output: 3
```

In this example, one optimal sequence of operations is to copy once and paste twice.

### Solution Explanation

Unlike typical dynamic programming problems that use addition or subtraction, this problem requires multiplication and division for state transitions because the paste operation doubles the length. We use a one-dimensional array `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of operations needed to extend the string to length `i`. For each position `j`, if `j` divides `i`, then length `i` can be achieved by operating on length `j`. The number of operations needed is equivalent to extending length `j` to length `i / j`. Thus, the recursive formula is `dp[i] = dp[j] + dp[i / j]`.

        for (int j = 2; j * j <= i; ++j) {

                dp[i] = dp[j] + dp[i / j];
                // Early pruning since smaller j guarantees the minimal operations.
                break;
