# 2.4 Sliding Window

## [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

### Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the length of the shortest contiguous substring in `s` that contains all characters of `t`. The solution must have a time complexity of no more than $O(n)$.


### Input and Output Example

The input consists of two strings `s` and `t`, and the output is a substring of `s`. If no solution exists, return an empty string.


```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```

In this example, the shortest substring in `s` that contains one `A`, one `B`, and one `C` is "BANC".


### Solution Explanation

This problem can be solved using the sliding window technique. Two pointers, `l` and `r`, both move from the leftmost to the rightmost position, with `l` always positioned at or before `r`. In the C++ solution, two arrays of length 128, `valid` and `freq`, are used to map characters (ASCII contains only 128 characters). The `valid` array indicates whether a character exists in `t`, and the `freq` array indicates the number of characters in `t` that are still missing in the sliding window of `s`: a positive value indicates missing characters, while a negative value indicates surplus characters. In the Python solution, the `Counter` data structure is used to simultaneously track characters in `t` and their missing quantities (a dictionary can also be used instead).

Even though the solution contains a `while` loop nested inside a `for` loop, the `while` loop moves the `l` pointer from left to right only once, so the total time complexity remains $O(n)$.
