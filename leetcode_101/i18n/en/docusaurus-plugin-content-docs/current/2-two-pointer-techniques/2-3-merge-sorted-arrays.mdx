# 2.3 Merging Two Sorted Arrays

## [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

### Problem Description

Given two sorted arrays, merge them into one array.

### Input and Output Example

The input consists of two arrays and their respective lengths `m` and `n`. The length of the first array is extended to `m + n`, with the extra `n` positions filled with `0`s. The task is to merge the second array into the first array without allocating additional space.


```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: nums1 = [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```


### Solution Explanation

Since both arrays are already sorted, we can place two pointers at the end of each array: at the `(m - 1)` position of `nums1` and the `(n - 1)` position of `nums2`. Each time, copy the larger number to the end of `nums1` and move the pointer one position to the left. 

To keep track of `nums1`'s end position, we also need a third pointer for copying. In the following code, we use `m` and `n` as pointers for the two arrays and create an additional pointer, `pos`, initially set to `m + n - 1`. Each time we move `m` or `n` to the left, we also move `pos` to the left. Note that if all numbers from `nums1` have been copied, don't forget to continue copying numbers from `nums2`; if all numbers from `nums2` have been copied, the remaining numbers in `nums1` do not need to change as they are already sorted.

In the C++ solution, we use the `++` and `--` shorthand: both `a++` and `++a` increment `a` by 1, but `a++` returns the original value of `a`, while `++a` returns `a + 1`. If you only want to increase `a` without needing a return value, either syntax is fine (`++a` is slightly faster in unoptimized code).
