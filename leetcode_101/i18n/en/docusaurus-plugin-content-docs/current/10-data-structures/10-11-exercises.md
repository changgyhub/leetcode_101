# 10.11 Exercises

## Basic Difficulty

### [566. Reshape the Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-the-matrix/)

This problem is not particularly challenging; it only requires some patience.

---

### [225. Implement Stack using Queues](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/)

Using a similar approach, we can also implement a stack using queues.

---

### [503. Next Greater Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)

A variant of the `Daily Temperatures` problem.

---

### [217. Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

Which data structure would allow us to quickly check for duplicates?

---

### [697. Degree of an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/degree-of-an-array/)

How can we preprocess an array to correctly and efficiently compute the length of a subarray?

---

### [594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/)

A variant of the `Longest Consecutive Sequence` problem.

---

### [15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

Since the complexity of sorting is $O(n \log n) < O(n^2)$, we can either sort the array first and then perform an $O(n^2)$ pointer search, or directly use a hash table for an $O(n^2)$ search.

## Advanced Difficulty

---

### [287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

A variant of the `Find Missing Number` problem. Besides marking negative values, are there any other algorithms to solve this?

---

### [313. Super Ugly Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/super-ugly-number/)

Try solving this using a priority queue.

---

### [870. Advantage Shuffle](https://leetcode.com/problems/advantage-shuffle/)

If we need to compare relative sizes and the same number can appear multiple times, which data structure should we use?

---

### [307. Range Sum Query - Mutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-mutable/)

A variant of the `Prefix Sum` problem. I admit this might be slightly advanced; you might want to look up what a `Segment Tree` is.
