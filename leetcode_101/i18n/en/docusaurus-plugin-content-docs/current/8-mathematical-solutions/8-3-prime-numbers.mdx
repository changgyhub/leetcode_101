# 8.3 Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. It is important to note that every number can be expressed as a product of prime numbers.


## [204. Count Primes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-primes/)

### Problem Description

Given a number \( n \), find the count of prime numbers less than \( n \).

### Input and Output Example

Input an integer and output another integer representing the count of prime numbers less than the input number.

```
Input: 10
Output: 4
```

In this example, the prime numbers less than 10 are [2, 3, 5, 7].

### Solution Explanation

The `Sieve of Eratosthenes` is a widely used algorithm for determining whether an integer is a prime number. It is particularly efficient for determining all prime numbers less than a given integer $n$. The principle is simple: iterate through numbers from $1$ to $n$, and for the current number $m$, mark all multiples of $m$ (less than $n$) as composite numbers. After processing, the numbers not marked as composite are prime.

By leveraging certain properties of prime numbers, we can further optimize this algorithm.
