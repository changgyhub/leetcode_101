# 8.2 Least Common Multiple and Greatest Common Divisor

Using the `Euclidean algorithm`, we can efficiently calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Multiplying the two numbers and dividing the product by their GCD gives the least common multiple (LCM).

```cpp
int gcd(int a, int b) { 
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b); 
}

int lcm(int a, int b) { 
    return a * b / gcd(a, b); 
}
```

```py
def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:

def lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
```

Furthermore, using the extended Euclidean algorithm (extended GCD), we can calculate not only the GCD of a and b but also their coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). In Python, since int is passed by value, we can use a fixed-length list() to achieve reference passing.

        x = 1, y = 0;
        return a;
    }
    int x_inner, y_inner;
    int gcd = xGCD(b, a % b, x_inner, y_inner);
    x = y_inner, y = x_inner - (a / b) * y_inner;
    return gcd;
}
