# 8.5 Random and Sampling

## [384. Shuffle an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-an-array/)

### Problem Description

Given an array, implement two functions. The first function `shuffle` randomly shuffles the array, and the second function `reset` restores the array to its original order.

### Input and Output Example

Input is an array of integers and a list of function names. Output is a two-dimensional array representing the result of each function call.

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], actions: ["shuffle","shuffle","reset"]
Output: [[2,1,3],[3,2,1],[1,2,3]]
```

In this example, the first two shuffle results can be any random permutations.

### Solution Explanation

We use the classical `Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm`, which works by swapping elements randomly to shuffle the array. Both forward and backward implementations are equally valid. Pay attention to the implementation details of the `reset` function and the constructor of the `Solution` class.

            swap(shuffled[i], shuffled[rand() % (i + 1)]);
        }
        // Forward shuffle: another valid approach.
        // for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // int pos = rand() % (n - i);
        // swap(shuffled[i], shuffled[i+pos]);
        // }

    }

## [528. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)

### Problem Description

Given an array where each position's value represents its weight, implement a method to randomly sample indices based on these weights.

### Input and Output Example

Input consists of a one-dimensional positive integer array representing weights, and another one-dimensional string array of commands specifying the number of random samples. Output is a one-dimensional integer array indicating the sampled indices.

```
Input: weights = [1,3], actions: ["pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
Output: [0,1,1]
```

In this example, the chosen index is uncertain each time, but the expected probability for index 0 is 1/4, and for index 1 is 3/4.

### Solution Explanation

We can first calculate the prefix sum using `partial_sum`, which gives the cumulative sum of weights up to each position. The resulting array for positive integers is monotonically increasing. When sampling, we generate a random number and use binary search to locate its position within the prefix sum, simulating the weighted sampling process. This binary search can be implemented using `lower_bound`.

For the example, the prefix sum of weights [1,3] is [1,4]. If the random number is 1, `lower_bound` returns 0; if the random number is 2, 3, or 4, `lower_bound` returns 1.

We'll delve deeper into prefix sum techniques in the following sections.

    }

    int pickIndex() {
        int val = (rand() % cumsum_.back()) + 1;
        return lower_bound(cumsum_.begin(), cumsum_.end(), val) -
               cumsum_.begin();
    }

        def pickIndex(self) -> int:
            val = random.randint(1, self.cumsum[-1])
            return bisect.bisect_left(self.cumsum, val, 0, len(self.cumsum))

## [382. Linked List Random Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-random-node/)

### Problem Description

Given a singly linked list, design an algorithm to randomly return one of its values.

### Input and Output Example

Input is a singly linked list, output is a number representing the value of one of its nodes.

```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 3
```

In this example, each node has an equal chance of being selected, such as node 3.

### Solution Explanation

Unlike arrays, where the total size is known, we cannot determine the total length of a linked list before traversal. In this scenario, we can use **reservoir sampling**: traverse the linked list, and at the $m$-th node, choose it with a probability of $\frac{1}{m}$ to replace the previously chosen node.

A simple proof of the randomness of reservoir sampling is as follows: for the $m$-th node in a linked list of length $n$, the sufficient and necessary condition for it to be sampled is that it is chosen, and none of the subsequent nodes are chosen. The probability is calculated as:

$$
\frac{1}{m} × \frac{m}{m+1} × \frac{m+1}{m+2} × · · · × \frac{n−1}{n} = \frac{1}{n}
$$

Thus, each node has an equal probability of being selected.

Alternatively, we can preprocess the linked list by traversing it once and converting it into an array for easier random access.
