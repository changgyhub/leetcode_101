# 11.5 Exercises

## Basic Difficulty

### [409. Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/)

Calculate the maximum length of a palindrome string that can be constructed from a set of characters. Auxiliary data structures can be used for counting.

---

### [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Compute the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. Similarly, auxiliary data structures can be used for tracking character occurrences.

---

## Advanced Difficulty

### [772. Basic Calculator III](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-iii/)

A follow-up to Problem 227. Highly recommended for practice.

---

### [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

Similar to the subsequence problems discussed earlier, subarray or substring problems can often be solved using dynamic programming. Start by implementing a $O(n^2)$ solution with dynamic programming, then explore Manacher's Algorithm, which can solve the problem in $O(n)$ time.
